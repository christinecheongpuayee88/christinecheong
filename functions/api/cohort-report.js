${rawData}

#################

Structure your response exactly as follows:

## 📋 Beginning of Class Report

n = [n]

* **Industry / Role:** [industry — job role, or the spread across respondents]
* **Experience:** [time series experience level(s) / programming experience level(s)]
* **Confidence:** [x/5 — one-word read: low / moderate / high baseline]
* **Learning goal:** [what they most want to learn, condensed]
* **Business problem:** [the forecasting problem they're facing, condensed]

**Takeaway:** [1-2 sentences connecting confidence, experience, and stated goal/problem into one instructor-facing insight — what should they watch for or set up early because of this specific combination?]

Output plain text using exactly that Markdown structure (## heading, * bullets, **bold**). Do not wrap the output in a code fence, HTML tags, a <style> block, or a full HTML document — start directly with the ## heading and end after the Takeaway line, with no other text before or after.`;

${styleNote}

### RAW CHECKPOINT 1 DATA (SARIMA, 6 questions, includes each respondent's selected answer and points scored) ###
${rawData}

### ANSWER KEY (for interpreting which wrong answers reveal which misconception) ###
1. In ARIMA(p,d,q), what does d represent? → Order of differencing needed for stationarity
2. Which ACF/PACF pattern points to an AR(p) process rather than MA(q)? → ACF decays gradually, PACF cuts off after lag p
3. In SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s, what does s represent? → Number of periods per season
4. Why do we need seasonal differencing in addition to regular differencing? → Regular differencing removes trend; seasonal differencing removes the repeating s-period pattern
5. Between two candidate SARIMA models with white-noise residuals, which do you prefer? → The one with the lower AIC/BIC
6. True/False — a well-fitted SARIMA model should leave residuals that look like white noise → True

Structure your response exactly as follows:

## 📊 Checkpoint 1 Report — SARIMA

n = [n] · Score: [avg]/6

**Where struggling:**
* For each question with a meaningful wrong answer, one line: [question topic]: picked "[wrong answer]" → [the specific misconception this reveals]. Mark questions everyone got right as "✅ correct" instead of a bullet.

**Vs. the Beginning baseline:** [1-2 sentences comparing actual SARIMA performance against the confidence level and stated goal from the Beginning Report — over-confident, under-confident, or on track? Note whether the errors are conceptual or just notation/labeling confusion.]

**Recommendation before ARIMAX:** [one crisp, concrete, immediately actionable sentence — not a list]

Output plain text using exactly that Markdown structure (## heading, ** bold labels, * bullets). Do not wrap the output in a code fence, HTML tags, a <style> block, or a full HTML document — start directly with the ## heading and end after the Recommendation line, with no other text before or after.`;

${styleNote}

### RAW CHECKPOINT 2 DATA (ARIMAX, 5 questions, includes each respondent's selected answer and points scored) ###
${rawData}

### ANSWER KEY (for interpreting which wrong answers reveal which misconception) ###
1. What's the key difference between ARIMA and ARIMAX? → ARIMAX adds an exogenous predictor (a leading indicator) on top of Y's own past
2. In the Advertising → Sales example, which is X and which is Y? → X = Advertising spend, Y = Sales
3. Why include lagged versions of the exogenous variable instead of just its current value? → The effect of X on Y is often delayed/distributed over time — a dynamic transfer-function relationship
4. True/False — models were compared using MAPE on a held-out test set → True
5. If adding more advertising lags worsens out-of-sample MAPE, what should you do? → Drop the less useful lags — more lags isn't automatically better; watch for overfitting

**Recommendation for time remaining:** [one crisp, concrete, immediately actionable sentence — not a list]

* **Will apply to:** [where they said they'll apply this]

**The journey, in one narrative:** [2-3 sentences connecting the stated goal/business problem from the Beginning Report → the comprehension arc across both checkpoints → where they landed by reflection — did the day deliver on what they came in hoping for?]

**What's still unclear:** [quote or closely paraphrase their remaining-questions answer; call out if it echoes a Beginning-of-class question or a checkpoint misconception that was never resolved]
