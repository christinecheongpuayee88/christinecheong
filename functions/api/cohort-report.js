## 📊 Beginning of Class Report

### 1. Cohort Snapshot
* **Responses analyzed:** [n]
* **Average self-rated comfort (ACF/PACF/AR/I/MA):** [x / 5]

### 2. Use-Cases & Goals
* [Summarize the recurring use-cases and the problem types the cohort said they want to solve]

### 3. Starting Comfort Level
* [Characterize the spread of comfort ratings — is the room mostly beginner, mixed, or already comfortable with the core terms?]

### 4. Recommendation — What to Emphasize Early
* [1-2 concrete instructions for how to pitch the opening material given this specific cohort's stated goals and comfort level]

### RAW CHECKPOINT 1 DATA (SARIMA, 6 questions, includes each respondent's selected answer and points scored) ###
${rawData}

### ANSWER KEY (for interpreting which wrong answers reveal which misconception) ###
1. In ARIMA(p,d,q), what does d represent? → Order of differencing needed for stationarity
2. Which ACF/PACF pattern points to an AR(p) process rather than MA(q)? → ACF decays gradually, PACF cuts off after lag p
3. In SARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)s, what does s represent? → Number of periods per season
4. Why do we need seasonal differencing in addition to regular differencing? → Regular differencing removes trend; seasonal differencing removes the repeating s-period pattern
5. Between two candidate SARIMA models with white-noise residuals, which do you prefer? → The one with the lower AIC/BIC
6. True/False — a well-fitted SARIMA model should leave residuals that look like white noise → True

### 1. Checkpoint Snapshot
* **Responses analyzed:** [n]
* **Score distribution:** [average / n out of 6, spread across the room]

### 2. Where the Cohort is Struggling
* [For each question with meaningful wrong-answer clustering, name the question and the specific misconception the wrong answer implies — not just "many got it wrong"]

### 3. Progress vs. the Room's Own Expectations
* [Compare actual SARIMA performance against the self-rated comfort level and stated goals from the Beginning Report — are they over-confident, under-confident, or on track relative to what they told you at the start?]

### 4. Recommendation — What To Do Before ARIMAX
* [1-2 concrete, immediately actionable instructions: what to re-explain right now, whether to slow down or move on, which specific example to revisit]

### RAW CHECKPOINT 2 DATA (ARIMAX, 5 questions, includes each respondent's selected answer and points scored) ###
${rawData}

### ANSWER KEY (for interpreting which wrong answers reveal which misconception) ###
1. What's the key difference between ARIMA and ARIMAX? → ARIMAX adds an exogenous predictor (a leading indicator) on top of Y's own past
2. In the Advertising → Sales example, which is X and which is Y? → X = Advertising spend, Y = Sales
3. Why include lagged versions of the exogenous variable instead of just its current value? → The effect of X on Y is often delayed/distributed over time — a dynamic transfer-function relationship
4. True/False — models were compared using MAPE on a held-out test set → True
5. If adding more advertising lags worsens out-of-sample MAPE, what should you do? → Drop the less useful lags — more lags isn't automatically better; watch for overfitting
